Drift is a journal of roamings in the margins of archaeology.

Drift is not a blog. Drift is not a provocation. Drift is a dead serious archaeological publication.

Drift is necessary because of the increasingly predictable and monotonous experience of archaeology.

Drift is a revolutionary journal that combats th√üe malaise and boredom of current archaeology, as well as its overproduction and predictability.

In contrast to moving straight forward, busily publishing results, as cogs in the science machine, accumulating papers and citations, drifters and roamers love archaeology, want to know it better, and want to explore its different ambiences, settings and atmospheres. Drifters and roamers are inspired by less visited and trodden paths, fascinated by margins and unruly edges, by lost and abandoned places.

We drift and roam for the purpose of reawakening and pursuing authentic desires, experiencing the feeling of life and adventure, and the emancipation of archaeology as a creative and liberating practice.

Drifts and roams are unplanned, spontaneous, and accidental; they are guided by chance encounters and happy mistakes. One might even get lost, but this is also part of roaming.

One can drift alone, but we believe the most fruitful arrangement consists of several people either roaming together or sharing the accounts of their drifts. We believe that cross-checking these different impressions makes it possible to arrive at somewhat objective conclusions.

Drift: Roamings in the Margins of Archaeology is a journal of playful-constructive behaviour and exploration of archaeology.
