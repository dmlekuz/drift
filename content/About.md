_Drift: as journal of romings in the margins of archaeology_ is independednt, free,  global and open journal that encourages free exploration of ideas, permitting writing in a conversational, introspective style that doesn’t easily fit elsewhere. 

Drifts and roams are short papers, experimental, speculative, reflexive essays and works, reflections, interventions, provocations, and situations; other media is welcome, publishing mediums (online) permitting.

Reflection and reference are good and necessary; acknowledging and greeting others is cordial; formal citations are not required.

There is no peer review; This does not mean that anything goes. Drifts and roams are accepted by the editorial board.

Joint roams (as multiple author single papers or entire issues) are welcome and encouraged.
