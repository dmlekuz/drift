A new focus on scientific methods, quantitative modelling, and Big Data, which characterise the “third scientific revolution” in archaeology (Kristiansen 2014), has expanded the boundaries of what we humans can ever know about the past.

However, aDNA analyses, Big Data, and evolutionary models reduce humans to either genes, numbers, or simply another animal species. What makes humans specific and archaeology a unique discipline (rather than, say, palaeontology) is a certain excess, a surplus that we humans have and cannot be studied by scientific methods. Language.

As an abstract system of differences between signs, language is a pure structure with no material presence. Yet, it shapes every human engagement with the world and pervades the human body. Language permeates everything humans do.

Lacanian psychoanalysis challenges the commonsense notion of language as a purely instrumental means of communication, as signs that transmit meanings. We, humans, dwell in a language; we are caught by it; tricked by it; language determines the fundamental coordinates of our world or our engagement with reality. Language is our second nature (Žižek 2006, 7–21).
There is nothing outside the language, not even our material engagement with the world. I will argue that the technical engagement with the material world is structured as language; it is language, encrusted upon matter, producing things.

## Chaîne opératoire

All technical activities, all material engagements with the world follow a sequence of operations and involve visible and invisible transformations of matter. This is the starting point of Leroi-Gourhan’s concept of the chaîne opératoire or operational sequence (Leroi-Gourhan 1993).
The chaîne opératoire is the place where the interaction between the socialised human body and the physical world takes place through a sequence of gestures. It is the nexus of interaction between body, mind, social and material world (Schlanger 1994).

Dynamic enactment of the technical process takes place in the interaction between the trained body, the material and the rules that guide the process. These rules are not a fixed recipe (push this, cut that, strike that), but rather rules about the relationships between operations, syntactic rules (Leroi-Gourhan 1993, 130–34). If these rules are not respected, the artisan has no control over the manufacturing process.

## Signifying chains
I argue that operational sequence is isomorphic with language. Language is defined by structural linguistics as a structure composed of differential elements, the signs. According to Ferdinand de Saussure, a sign is a unity composed of the signifier, the phonological element of the sign, an ’acoustic image’ which signifies a signfied, a mental image or concept (Saussure 2001).
While Saussure argues that the signifier and the signified are mutually dependent and form a unity, Jacques Lacan argues that the signifier is primary and produces the signified. The signifier is primarily a meaningless material element in a closed differential system. Whereas for Saussure signification was a stable bond between signifier and signified, Lacan finds an unstable, fluid relationship (Lacan 1999,  14–25; Lacan 2002, 112–15).
It is impossible to establish a stable one-to-one connection between signifier and signified. Signification, for Lacan, is not a fixed connection between signifier and signified, but a process in which the play of signifiers creates the illusion of he signified through the twin tropes of metonymy and metaphor.

Language is, therefore, a signifyning chain, a stream of signifiers combined according to the laws of grammar (Lacan 2002, 116).

This signifying chain has two axes. The first is a diachronic relation between one signifier and another in the chain. This axis describes the metonymic relation between signifiers (Lacan 2002, 119). Metonymy, then, concerns the way signifiers can be linked in a single signifying chain, a horizontal, syntactic relationship between signifiers.

The synchronic axis describes how a signifier in one signifying chain can be substituted for a signifier in another chain; this is the metaphoric relation between signifiers. Together, metaphor and metonymy constitute how signification or meaning is produced (Lacan 2002, 119–20).

For example, in the sentence ’cat sat on a mat’, the relation between the words ’cat’ and ’sat’ is a metonymic relation, while the possibility of replacing ’cat’ with ’kitten’ depends on the metaphoric relation between these two terms.

The signifying chain is metonymic in the production of meaning; signification is not present at any point in the chain, but rather meaning insists in the movement from one signifier to another. But even when signifieds or meanings are produced, they are constantly slipping under the signifier. The only things that detain this movement temporarily, pinning the signifier to the signified for a brief moment, and creating the illusion of stable meaning, are the anchoring points, point de capiton; pauses, halts, stoppages in the signifying chain when meaning is established retroactively (Lacan 2002, 231).
For example, note how the meaning shifts and changes as we move along the chain of signifiers, “the situation is catastrophic, but not serious.”

## Chaîne opératoire is a language

There is a striking structural similarity between the sequence of signifiers that constitute a language and a chain of operations in the chaîne opératoire.
Each individual operation consists of the material form, the gesture, and an intended effect on the material world. The gesture thus has the position of a signifier, while the intended, expected effect of that gesture, the idea of what effect should it produce on the matter is the signified.
The relationship between the gesture and the intended material effect is somewhat arbitrary and highly unstable. There is no one-to-one relationship between the gesture and its effect. The ambiguity of gesture is because it is the trained body that performs the gesture, that gestures often use tools and work with different materials. Thus the intended effect can never be taken for granted; there is always the possibility that something goes wrong, that the material will respond unpredictably to the gesture, that the gesture is not executed correctly or that the tool is not sharp enough.

The technical engagement with the material world cannot be understood in isolation, but only as part of a chain of operations, as a dynamic process that refers to the rules that guide the manufacturing process. These rules should be understood as the syntax, as rules about relationships that chain gestures together in an operational sequence (Leroi-Gourhan 1993,  130–34).
The chain consists of the grammatical and contextual links between the operation performed and the operations performed before and after it. No operation has a fixed meaning, provided that it is used in a particular context.

Different gestures can have a similar effect; for example, punching and drilling both create a hole. So they can be used interchangeably, creating a metaphorical relationship between them.
Gestures are combined in a sequence on the metonymic or diachronic axis, creating a never-ending flow of gestures. But the key is pauses, breaks and stoppages; for example, in making a stone tool, we continue the reduction sequence on a core; all we are left with is a pile of debitage. For example, a finished tool, biface, is made only when we stop at the right moment.
Stable things, meaningful objects, thus come into being at certain anchor points, where meaning or product of the operation sequence is fixed,  post factum.

These objects then become a stable entities, things, products, tools, recognised within discourse, usually with a name and a socially expected mode of use, and can then be used in other operational sequences. On the other hand, the reduction sequence on the tool can be continued, it can be retouched, reduce to something else, recycled, again creating a new meaning, a new thing, a new tool.

## Discourse

Language is both individual (speech) and collective. Lacan uses the term ’discourse’ to emphasise the trans-individual nature of language (Lacan 1999,  17). We are born in discourse, which precedes our birth and lives on after our death. Language enables us to clue each other, to share our desires and wishes, which are in turn are moulded by language. Once a child enters into language and accepts the rules and dictates of society, they also enters a community of others; discourse binds us together into a shared social pact, a symbolic order (Lacan 1999,  51).

Language is an uninvited intruder from the outside, a chain of signifying elements that unfolds according to its own very precise rules. Discourse constitutes a mnemonic device; it is a memory in a way. The discourse is full of other peoples talk, conversation, goals, aspirations and fantasies (Fink 1997, 9–10, 14–23).

The same holds for the technical engagement with the world. A gesture is at the same time individual and collective, concrete and abstract. Gesture, as part of an operational sequence, involves not only the movement of the body but also the abstract knowledge. Leroi-Gourhan highlights the collective knowledge that stands behind individual human action (Leroi-Gourhan 1993, 257–59). We might call it ‘material discourse’, patterns of trained gestures imprinted on the matter. These patterns are sometimes conscious and expressed in a language, but most of the time, non-discursive embodied in bodies and things.

We are born into a world that has been transformed by a deep history of technological operations. Tools, artefacts, places, a whole world of things into which we are born into embody collective technical knowledge. They testify of a material discourse. The moment the subject begins to engage with the world, they enters into a relationship with this material discourse. It addresses them from elsewhere, through the collective action of other, long-forgotten subjects, through the medium of things formed through chaines operatiores.

Things, the results of human engagement with the world, thus have their own autonomy; they live a life of their own. Precisely because a thing is made by a distinct sequence, this limit the artisan in making the artefact. The artisan must follow the logic of the chaîne opératoire if they is to produce something that will be recognised (within discourse) as an object  (Gell 1998; Gosden 2005) Thus as soon as the artisan identifies with the art, they loses themselves in it, as an object (cf. Lacan 1998, 246; Fink 1997, 7–21).
One of the most critical implications of psychoanalysis is that language has its own autonomy. Language in the form of discourse speaks through us (Lacan 2002, 61–62; Žižek 2006, 7–21). We are not the masters in our own house.
In the same way, things act through us. Objects shape the way we act through their own logic, which is somehow independent of individual intentions but instead follows the logic (or desire) of the material discourse. This logic is locked in connections between operations; sequence of operations, it consists in this very connection. It is knowledge without a subject that addresses us through a world of things (cf. Fink 1997, 7–21).

## Conclusion
Technical engagement with the world is structured as a language. It is a language, a system of differences between operations. It consists of linguistic elements, phrases, expressions, commands, laws and conventions that are part of the material discourse. It is part of the culture at large, symbolic order, a shared social world of language, intersubjective relations, knowledge, ideological conventions and the law.

Even if it communicates nothing, even if it produces nothing of use, material discourse stands for the existence of shared technical knowledge (cf. Lacan 2002, 33). The work of archaeology is to recognise discourse encrusted upon things. When we recognise an oddly shaped stone as a handaxe, we recognise human work on a matter, matter marked by the excess of language; we acknowledge the existence of the symbolic order.

The idea of shared material discourse is of an alternative take on the concept of archaeological culture, but where objects have autonomy and act through us. Culture, culture at large, is an effects of grammar, encrusted upon things.
