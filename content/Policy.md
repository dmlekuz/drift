_Drift: as journal of romings in the margins of archaeology_ is independednt, free,  global and open journal that encourages free exploration of ideas, permitting writing in a conversational, introspective style that doesnâ€™t easily fit elsewhere. 

Drifts and roams are short papers, experimental, speculative, reflexive essays and works, reflections, interventions, provocations, and situations; other media is welcome, publishing mediums (online) permitting.

Reflection and reference are good and necessary; acknowledging and greeting others is cordial; formal citations are not required.

There is no peer review; This does not mean that anything goes. Drifts and roams are accepted by the editorial board.

The editorial board is open, and its composition is fluid. Fellow drifters and roamers may join (and leave) as they please.

Joint roams (as multiple author single papers or entire issues) are welcome and encouraged.
