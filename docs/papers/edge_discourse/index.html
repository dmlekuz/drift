    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>The landscape is something that relaltional to the subject inhabiting it. My exploration of this relation is heavily influenced by Lacanaian psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis can be defined as a discipline that provides basic coordinates on subjects’ relation to the Other, to some outside structure. Lacanian’s point of departure is that humans are speaking beings. This makes us alienated from the world because our relation to the world and others is mediated by language. Thus, humans inhabit the landscape as embodied but also as speaking and thinking subjects.
Lacan sees the subject’s relation to the world through three interlocking registers: Imaginary, Symbolic and Real.</p>
<p>Imaginary captures most of what is experienced as normal, conscious reality. The Imaginary is primarily comprised of perceived images. Lacan presents the Imaginary as a necessary fiction that allows the psychoanalytic subject to live in and engage with their surroundings.</p>
<p>In this way, it is very similar to the Jakob von Uexküll concept of <em>Umwelt</em> or J. J. Gibson’s (1986) <em>direct perception</em>, where organism and environment are complementary, and meaning is directly available in the world as significations that offer opportunities for action, as affordances. Jakob von Uexküll, for example, sees the relation between organism and environment as harmonious, whole, and the organism fully immersed in the environment.</p>
<p>What is unique about human beings is that the added dimension of the Symbolic distorts the Imaginary order.</p>
<p>The Symbolic is the register, first and foremost, of language but also all the other social and representational structures that the conscious daily life of human subjects rests upon. It is the realm of culture as opposed to the imaginary order of nature.</p>
<p>The Imaginary is what human and non-human animals have in common, except that in humans, it is no longer a natural imaginary. The symbolic order radically alienates human beings from the natural order. With humans, even the significations of the most purely biological needs and relations with the environment are subject to the laws of the Symbolic. Human sexuality and foodways are the best examples of this.
The totalising, all-encompassing effect of the symbolic order leads Lacan to speak of the Symbolic as a universe in which we are immersed (Lacan 1991, 29).</p>
<p>Lacan thus argues that natural harmony in man is profoundly disconcerted, and there is not even a purely natural state at the beginning in which the human subject might exist before being caught up in the symbolic order. As Slavoj Žižek (2006, 40&ndash;41) puts it: “The symbolic order is the second nature of every speaking being: it is here, directing and controlling my acts, as it were, swim in it, but it nonetheless remains ultimately impenetrable, and I cannot ever put it in front of me and fully grasp it.”</p>
<p>Thus, the natural harmony between the environment and organism, described by Jakob von Uexkull, is fundamentally broken with humans due to the fact that humans are immersed in a Symbolic order. The fact that the materiality of existence (the Real) always exceeds and undercuts the meaning structures of the symbolic order.
Thus the Symbolic is also the realm of radical alterity, which Lacan refers to as the big Other. Whereas the Imaginary is characterised by dual, direct relations between the environment and organisms, the symbolic is characterised by triadic structures because the relations between people are always mediated by a third, the big Other. The big Other is embedded in Lacan’s symbolic order, language, norms, and structured and ordered space.</p>
<p>Landscapes are where the humans as speaking subjects as well as spatial subjects are aligned through problematic and confusing relations. The subject is in an imaginary and symbolic relation to the places. However, the imaginary order in human beings is structured by the symbolic, and this means that, with humans, the harmonious imaginary relation with the environment (as described by von Uexkull) has deviated from the natural one. There is nothing natural about the landscapes. Landscape is a symbolic construct that makes certain things accessible to thought and perception and rules out others. Landscape is not given; it is not a simple fact of experience.
Humans inhabit the landscape as embodied creatures but also as speaking beings. In J. J. Gibsons,’ direct perception’ meaning is directly available in the world as significations that offer opportunities for action through affordances. In my opinion, the fact that we are speaking beings complicates this immensely, as the meanings associated with an affordance are symbolically overdetermined. In short, when I perceive a cave, for example, this perception is given its specific spin by the word “cave” that resonates in it, for example, an entrance to the underworld, a lair of some powerful entity, a house of ancestors. A whole imaginary can be evoked simply by calling something a “cave”. This is the paradox of symbolic overdetermination: when I encounter a cave, it is the signifier “cave” that confers the rich and complex texture of meaning that colours this perception.
We, humans, conceptualise space by ordering it, rearranging it, modifying it, building, thinking and speaking about it; by making places. This is a discrusive practice. Landscape is a discourse in which we negotiate with our bodies and minds. The subject uses the places to locate themselves, whether the space is accessible or not. And in their many and varied forms, places represent the subject to itself and others.</p>
<p>But this landscape is also a place of radical alterity;
we are born in a landscape that precedes our birth and will live on after our death. Long before a child is born, a place is prepared for her or him in the world (Fink 1997, 3&ndash;13). The places child will inhabit have often been in use for decades, if not centuries; those places are handed down to them by centuries of tradition, of social life in a landscape. They constitute the Other of Landscape, or the Other as landscape. The landscape is thus full of other people’s places, paths, daily routines, conceptualisations, fantasies, desires, fears, and discourses, and we are thrown into it and make it our own.</p>
<p>Thus, in “Wisdom Sits in Places”, Keith Basso (1996) shows the deep connection between language, culture, and landscape among the Western Apache people, where places are not just physical locations but repositories of cultural memory and moral teachings. Stories tied to specific places serve as tools for understanding the past, guiding behaviour, and fostering wisdom. These places carry meanings that shape individual and collective identity, highlighting how landscapes are inseparable from the social and ethical life of the community.</p>
<p>The key concept that describes our relationship with the outside world is extimacy. Lacan coined the neologism extimité (extimacy) to denote a structure of subjectivity in which the most intimate, internal core is already external, thus complicating the traditional philosophical dualisms and binaries. The interior is present in the exterior and vice versa. The centre of the subject is outside, in a language, in a landscape. This is why Lacan argues, for example, that the unconscious ‘is outside’ and that the subject is not just de-centred but also ‘ex-centric’. Extimacy, then, allows us to understand how subjectivity, society and space take place through the twists and turns of external intimacy and intimate exteriority (Lacan 2008, 171).
It is an interplay of the transference of people’s intimate feelings, thoughts, and beliefs onto an external world, things, places, and landscapes and, on the other hand, the formation of people’s inner feelings, thoughts, and beliefs by an external world. This looping process complicates the demarcation of an ‘inside’ and an ‘outside’ comparable to the structure of a Moebius surface. Humans are de-centred and ex-centric, and this centre is also somewhere in the landscape.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is also Real. Real is more tricky; in Lacanian theory, the Real becomes that which resists representation; it is something pre-imaginary, pre-symbolic – what cannot be symbolised, what loses its ‘reality’ once it is symbolised through language. The Real is a hole, a gap, a slash in the middle of the symbolical order; it is the lack around which the symbolical order is structured. The Real is ‘the impossible’ because it is impossible to imagine, integrate into the symbolic order, and attain in any way. The real also has connotations of matter, implying a material substrate underlying the imaginary and the symbolic. The connotations of matter also link the concept of the real to the realm of biology and the body in its brute physicality (as opposed to the imaginary and symbolic functions of the body) or the geology and the material physical substrate of the landscape.</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in places where people experience the limit of symbolic order, the places where reality breaks down and the Real intrudes. Places that mark the limit of discourse (Mlekuž 2019).</p>
<p>Places of sublime beauty, abject disgust, and death are the intrusion of the Real. It is where normality, the everyday order, breaks down. There is always something more when we encounter the cave, for example, some excess of meaning that the language fails to comprehend fully. A gap fissure in a landscape is simultaneously a gap in the symbolic order, where we encounter the limit of discourse. That can be described as a specific affective atmosphere, a sense of uneasiness, a feeling of being haunted, of other presences located at the edge of awareness. This is a touch of Real, Lacanian Real. Those places and moments are an intrusion of something alien and unrecognisable, something that the usual grammar of the symbolic that conditions how to make meaning and how to proceed cannot fully fathom.</p>
<p>They can be approached through through the concept of the gaze. Gaze in Lacan’s later work refers to the uncanny sense that the object of our eye’s look or glance is somehow looking back at us of its own will (Lacan 1998, 92). This uncanny feeling of being gazed at by the object of our look affects us in the same way as castration anxiety (reminding us of the lack at the heart of the symbolic order). We may believe that we are in control of our eye’s look; however, this power is always undone because the materiality of existence (the Real) always exceeds and undercuts the meaning structures of the symbolic order. By having the object of our eyes look back at us, we are reminded of our own lack, of the fact that the symbolic order is separated only by a fragile border from the materiality of the Real. The fact that the materiality of existence (the Real) always exceeds and undercuts the meaning structures of the symbolic order.</p>
<p>Notions of sacred and numinous are ways of approaching the Real. Lacan claims that the gods belong to the order of the Real (Lacan 1998, 45). This is our effort to cover over the breakdowns and fissures (and subsequent reassertion of boundaries) associated with the abject, using the combination of images and words. Rituals reflect an effort to delineate the boundaries surrounding the intrusion of the Real and protect the symbolic order from the pollution or chaos embodied by the breakdown of the Symbolic. Ritual is thus technology for creating and maintaining symbolic order when facing the Real of the landscape.</p>
